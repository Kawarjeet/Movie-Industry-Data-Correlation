# Movie-Industry-Data-Correlation

The following project code carries out basic data cleaning and correlation on a movie dataset from Kaggle. 

The link for the dataset is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies

This is my another DIY project to understand the basic functionalities of various python libraries. 

I have used pandas, numpy and seaborn libraries in the project code. Also I have tried to understand the difference between kendall, spearman and pearson correlation.
