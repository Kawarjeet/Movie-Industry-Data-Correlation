# Movie-Industry-Data-Correlation-Project

The following project code carries out basic data cleaning and correlation on a movie dataset from Kaggle. 

The link for the dataset is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies

This is my another DIY project to understand the basic functionalities of various python libraries. 

I have used pandas, numpy and seaborn libraries in the project code. Also I have tried to understand the difference between kendall, spearman and pearson correlation. 

Terms and Definitions (source: https://www.statisticssolutions.com/free-resources/directory-of-statistical-analyses/correlation-pearson-kendall-spearman/)
- Correlation is a bivariate (involving or depending on two variables) analysis that measures the strength of association between two variables and the direction of their relationship. 
- The correlation coefficient can takes values between +1 and -1. 
- A correlation coefficient of +1 or -1 indicates a perfect degree of association between the two variables, and as the value approaches 0 the relationship between the two variables becomes weaker. 
- The direction of relationship is indicated by the sign of the coefficient; a (+) sign indicates a positive relationship and a (-) sign indicates a negative relationship.
- Usually in statistics, there are 4 kind of correlation: 
  (1) Pearson correlation
  (2) Kendall correlation
  (3) Spearman correlation
  (4) Point - Biserial correlation
